# Split a String into Words Using Recursion and Dynamic Memory Allocation

## **Problem Statement**
Write a C program that:
- Takes a string input from the user (e.g., "hello world recursion").
- Uses `calloc()` to dynamically allocate memory for an array of strings.
- Implements a **recursive function** to split the string into words based on spaces.
- Stores each word in a dynamically allocated memory space.
- Prints each word separately.
- Properly frees allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.

## **Expected Input/Output**
### **Example Input:**
```
Enter a sentence: hello world recursion
```
### **Expected Output:**
```
Word 1: hello
Word 2: world
Word 3: recursion
```
