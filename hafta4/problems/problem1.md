# Reverse a String Using Dynamic Memory Allocation and Recursion

## **Problem Statement**
Write a C program that:
- Takes a string input from the user.
- Uses `calloc()` to dynamically allocate memory for a copy of the string.
- Implements a recursive function to reverse the string.
- Prints both the original and reversed strings.
- Properly frees allocated memory to prevent memory leaks.

## **Expected Input/Output**
### **Example Input:**
```
Enter a string: recursion
```
### **Expected Output:**
```
Original String: recursion
Reversed Copy:   noisrucer
```
